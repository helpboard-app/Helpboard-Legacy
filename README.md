# Helpboard Legacy Repo

This is a very simple Github repository with all the pre-v3 versions of Helpboard that I could find. This repo is read-only as it is only here for refrence.
If you are looking for the latest version of Helpboard, either to contribute or to download it and run your own Helpboard instance:
[Click Here](https://github.com/helpboard-app/V3)
Otherwise you can use the code here for refrence or to deploy on your own servers.
Funny enough, currently the offical Helpboard instance, [helpboard.app](https://helpboard.app), is running a legacy version of Helpboard due to the fact that
Helpboard V3 hasn't been finished as of October 13, 2021.
